# Strip Theory Seakeeping Analysis Toolkit

This repository implements a Python-based strip theory solver for the **seakeeping analysis of a Wigley hull**.  
The toolkit calculates hydrodynamic coefficients (added mass, damping), ship responses, and visualizes hull geometry, using input sectional data and hydrodynamic curves.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project provides a modular codebase for simulating ship motions in waves using **strip theory**. It supports:

- Extraction and processing of hull sectional data  
- Calculation of sectional added mass, damping, and Î²â‚™ coefficients  
- RAO (Response Amplitude Operator) plot generation for heave motion  
- 3D visualization of hull geometry and motion results  
- Integration of experimental or theoretical hydrodynamic curves  

The design is extensible, enabling adaptation to different hulls and hydrodynamic datasets.
